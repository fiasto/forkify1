: A simple idea of this application is to show the different recipes of a searched food item. The user will not only see the different recipes but also learn how to cook them by clicking a directions button.Users can pick their favorite recipes by clicking ADD to the shopping list button and can see the different ingredients goes into a recipe and cooking duration.
This application relies highly on asynchronous javascript & API to update the content more dynamically and smoothly.
(E.x) dynamically update ingredients quantity based on the number of servings added.  displays different recipes based on the searched term
Note: This application is still under development yet to add cart and backend support.
